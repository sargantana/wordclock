# DIY ARDUINO WORDCLOCK

### What is this?
A WordClock is a device displaying the time in 5 minutes increments on a matrix of words spelling the time.
This Project deals with a DIY approach as a alternative for the 1.250â‚¬ priced original product.

Time is displayed in 12h format, chnging color from green to blue depending if its AM or PM.
Pins.h is used to define the I/O of the used board, the increment you want to increase/decrease the time while setting it (recommended are 5 minutes for obvious reasons).
Use WordMatrix.h to define the layout of your word matrix. The sketch is written to tell time in english language, but as I am german I changed a few things in my specific setup. Feel free to improve and enhance the sketch for other languages or setups.


## Attenion!
This code uses the Adafruit_Neopixel and Time libary. They are absolutly neccessary for this to work.

Get NeoPixel Libary here: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel

Get Time Libary here: https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/Time

## Recommended Hardware

* __(25x) WS2812b-based adressable LEDs (i.e. NeoPixel)__ // Number of Pixels used depends on you
* __2x Momentary push buttons__
* __Arduino based Board__
* __5V PSU capable of powering all Pixels at once + Arduino + overhead__ // you can calculate an average of ~65mA per Pixel
* __PCB__
* __Frame (i. e. IKEA Ribba picture frame)__
* __Faceplate__ // I lasercut this out of the IKEA Ribba backplate but you could also 3d print it

### Step 1
Change pins in Pins.h according to your setup

```
#define MINUS         4   // Declare pin for + Button
#define PLUS          5 	// Declare pin for - Button
#define STEP          5 	// Declare step size of time adjustement
#define PIN           3 	// Declare pin for NeoPixel DATA IN
#define NUMPIXELS     25	// Declare amount of NeoPixels used
```

### Step 2
Change the Layout/Sequence of your word matrix in WordMatrix.h according to your setup

I used an older version of the WordClockFacePlate by microcontroller.net

A Newer version (in german) can be found here:

There is a 3d printable .stl of this used faceplate ![here](github.com/sargantana/blob/branch/wordclock/CAD files/faceplate.stl)

### Step 2.5 (Optional tweaking)
If desired you can change the color pattern for the lighting depending if it is PM or AM

You can find these in the ![arduino sketch](/Arduino sketch/wordclock_sketch.ino)

Example for AM color settings (pure blue)
```
// RGB values for AM
int AMr=0;
int AMg=0;
int AMb=255;
```

### Step 3
After double checking everything upload to arduino. Turn on the wordclock and set the time with the buttons.
